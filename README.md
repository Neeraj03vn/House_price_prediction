# House Price Prediction Project

This project predicts house prices based on features like area, location, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.

## Files:
- `housing_prices.csv`: Dataset used
- `house_price_model.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook
- `model.pkl`: Trained Linear Regression model (optional)
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages

## How to Run:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook houseprice.ipynb`
3. Run each cell to train and test the model

## Output:
The model shows RÂ² score, RMSE, MAE and a scatter plot comparing actual vs predicted house prices.
